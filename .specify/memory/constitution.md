# Kode Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. First Principles Engineering
Software engineering decisions must be grounded in fundamental truths and reasoning from basic principles, not assumptions or cargo cult practices. Every architectural choice, tool selection, and implementation approach must be justified by clear technical reasoning. When faced with complexity, break problems down to their essential components and build solutions from the ground up. Question conventional wisdom and established patterns when they don't serve the specific problem at hand.

**Rationale**: Like Linus Torvalds' approach to kernel development, we prioritize understanding over convention, ensuring every decision serves a clear technical purpose rather than following trends or inherited practices.

### II. Simplicity and Minimalism
Choose the simplest solution that solves the actual problem. Avoid over-engineering, premature optimization, and unnecessary abstractions. Code should be readable, maintainable, and focused on solving real user problems. Every feature, dependency, and line of code must justify its existence.

**Rationale**: Complex systems are harder to debug, maintain, and reason about. Simple solutions are more robust and easier to evolve.

### III. Tool Mastery and Integration
Deep understanding of development tools, their capabilities, and limitations is essential. Tools should enhance productivity without creating dependencies that compromise system integrity. Integration between tools must be seamless and purposeful, not accidental complexity.

**Rationale**: Kode is a tool that integrates with many other tools (AI models, file systems, terminals). Mastery of these integrations is critical for reliable operation.

### IV. Autonomous Problem Solving
Systems and agents should be capable of independent reasoning and decision-making within their domain. This includes error recovery, context understanding, and adaptive behavior based on changing conditions. Human intervention should be needed only for high-level direction, not micro-management.

**Rationale**: AI coding assistants must operate autonomously to be truly useful, making intelligent decisions about code structure, tool usage, and problem-solving approaches.

### V. Empirical Validation
All claims about system behavior, performance, and correctness must be backed by empirical evidence. Testing is not optional but fundamental to understanding system behavior. Metrics and observability are essential for making informed decisions about system evolution.

**Rationale**: Software systems are complex and counterintuitive. Only through measurement and testing can we understand their true behavior and make reliable improvements.

## Development Standards

### Code Quality Requirements
- All code must be readable by someone unfamiliar with the codebase
- Functions and modules must have single, clear responsibilities
- Error handling must be explicit and comprehensive
- Performance characteristics must be understood and documented
- Dependencies must be minimal and well-justified

### Architecture Principles
- Modular design with clear interfaces between components
- Separation of concerns between different system layers
- Stateless operations where possible for reliability and scalability
- Clear data flow and minimal side effects
- Robust error propagation and recovery mechanisms

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Requirements
- Test-driven development for all new features
- Integration tests for tool interactions and agent behaviors
- Performance benchmarks for critical paths
- Error condition testing for robustness validation
- User scenario validation through end-to-end testing

### Review Standards
- All changes must be reviewed for adherence to first principles
- Architecture decisions must be documented with reasoning
- Performance implications must be considered and measured
- Security implications must be evaluated for all external integrations
- Backward compatibility must be maintained unless breaking changes are justified

## Governance

### Amendment Process
Constitution amendments require:
1. Clear technical justification for the change
2. Impact analysis on existing systems and processes
3. Migration plan for affected components
4. Community review and consensus building
5. Documentation updates across all dependent templates

### Compliance Verification
- All pull requests must demonstrate constitutional compliance
- Regular audits of system architecture against stated principles
- Performance and quality metrics must align with constitutional requirements
- Tool integrations must be evaluated for first principles adherence

### Version Management
- MAJOR: Fundamental principle changes or removals
- MINOR: New principles or significant expansions
- PATCH: Clarifications and non-semantic improvements
