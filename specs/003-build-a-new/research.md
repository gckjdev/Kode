# Research: Google Cloud SDK Tool

## Technical Decisions and Rationale

### Shell Execution Strategy
**Decision**: Use Node.js `child_process.spawn()` with streaming output
**Rationale**: 
- Preserves real-time output for long-running commands
- Maintains gcloud's authentication context and environment variables
- Supports interactive prompts and cancellation via signal handling
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
**Alternatives considered**: 
- `exec()` - rejected due to buffering limitations for long output
- Direct gcloud API calls - rejected as it bypasses gcloud's authentication and configuration

### Output Format Detection
**Decision**: Attempt JSON format first with `--format=json` flag, fallback to raw output
**Rationale**:
- Many gcloud commands support JSON output for structured data
- Preserves original formatting for commands that don't support JSON
- Enables better integration with other Kode tools
**Alternatives considered**:
- Always use raw output - rejected as it loses structured data benefits
- Parse text output - rejected due to complexity and fragility

### Authentication Handling
**Decision**: Detect authentication status via `gcloud auth list` and provide helpful guidance
**Rationale**:
- Respects user's existing gcloud authentication setup
- Provides clear guidance when authentication is needed
- Avoids managing credentials directly (security best practice)
**Alternatives considered**:
- Manage service account keys directly - rejected due to security complexity
- Force specific authentication method - rejected as it limits user flexibility

### Progress Indication for Long-Running Commands
**Decision**: Stream output in real-time with cancellation support via SIGTERM
**Rationale**:
- Users can see progress immediately
- Cancellation prevents resource waste
- Follows Unix signal conventions
**Alternatives considered**:
- Polling-based progress - rejected as gcloud doesn't provide standard progress APIs
- Timeout-only approach - rejected as it doesn't provide user control

### Command Validation Strategy
**Decision**: Execute commands directly and handle gcloud SDK errors
**Rationale**:
- gcloud SDK provides comprehensive error messages
- Avoids duplicating gcloud's command validation logic
- Simpler implementation with better error fidelity
**Alternatives considered**:
- Pre-validate command syntax - rejected due to complexity of maintaining gcloud command schemas
- Basic command existence check - rejected as insufficient for complex commands

### Integration with Kode Architecture
**Decision**: Follow JiraTool/ConfluenceTool modular pattern
**Rationale**:
- Proven architecture in existing tools
- Constitutional compliance (separation of concerns)
- Maintainable and testable structure
**Alternatives considered**:
- Monolithic single-file approach - rejected due to maintainability concerns
- Custom architecture - rejected as existing pattern works well

### Configuration Management
**Decision**: Extend global `.kode.json` with gcloud-specific settings
**Rationale**:
- Consistent with other tool configurations
- Allows customization of default behavior
- Supports multiple project contexts
**Alternatives considered**:
- Separate configuration file - rejected for consistency
- No configuration - rejected as it limits customization

### Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Unit tests with mocked shell execution, integration tests with real gcloud commands
**Rationale**:
- Fast unit tests for core logic
- Integration tests validate real-world scenarios
- Follows established Kode testing patterns
**Alternatives considered**:
- Only unit tests - rejected as shell integration is critical
- Only integration tests - rejected due to test speed and reliability concerns

## Dependencies Analysis

### Core Dependencies
- **child_process** (Node.js built-in): Shell execution and process management
- **zod**: Input validation and schema definition
- **React/Ink**: UI components and rendering
- **path/fs** (Node.js built-in): File system operations

### Development Dependencies
- **bun:test**: Test framework following Kode patterns
- **@types/node**: TypeScript definitions for Node.js APIs

### External Tool Dependencies
- **gcloud SDK**: Must be installed and available in PATH
- **Google Cloud Project**: User must have access to at least one GCP project

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **gcloud SDK availability**: Tool is useless without gcloud installed
  - Mitigation: Clear error messages with installation instructions
- **Authentication complexity**: GCP auth can be complex for new users
  - Mitigation: Helpful guidance and common troubleshooting tips

### Medium Risk
- **Command compatibility**: gcloud commands may change between SDK versions
  - Mitigation: Execute commands directly, let gcloud handle compatibility
- **Cross-platform differences**: Shell behavior varies between OS
  - Mitigation: Use Node.js abstractions, test on multiple platforms

### Low Risk
- **Performance**: Shell execution overhead
  - Mitigation: Minimal overhead for typical gcloud operations
- **Security**: Executing arbitrary commands
  - Mitigation: Tool only executes gcloud commands, user controls input

## Performance Considerations

### Command Startup Time
- Target: <500ms from tool invocation to command execution
- Factors: Node.js startup, gcloud SDK initialization
- Optimization: Minimal dependencies, efficient imports

### Output Streaming
- Requirement: Real-time output for long-running commands
- Implementation: Stream stdout/stderr directly to user
- Consideration: Handle large outputs without memory issues

### Resource Usage
- Memory: Minimal overhead beyond gcloud command requirements
- CPU: Negligible for command execution wrapper
- Network: Dependent on gcloud command being executed

## Integration Points

### Kode Tool System
- Follows established Tool interface patterns
- Integrates with permission system for command execution
- Uses standard rendering methods for output display

### Google Cloud SDK
- Respects gcloud configuration and authentication
- Preserves environment variables and context
- Handles all gcloud command variations

### Operating System
- Cross-platform shell execution
- Signal handling for command cancellation
- Path resolution for gcloud executable
