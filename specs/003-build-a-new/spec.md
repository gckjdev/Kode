# Feature Specification: Google Cloud SDK Tool

**Feature Branch**: `003-build-a-new`  
**Created**: January 1, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "build a new tool to execute gcloud sdk command in shell"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Extracted: Need for Google Cloud SDK command execution tool
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Developers, DevOps engineers, Cloud administrators
   ‚Üí Actions: Execute gcloud commands, manage GCP resources
   ‚Üí Data: Command inputs/outputs, authentication credentials
   ‚Üí Constraints: Shell execution, SDK availability
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Authentication method - service account, user auth, or both?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Command validation - should tool validate commands before execution?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Output format - raw output, structured JSON, or formatted display?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: User executes gcloud commands through Kode interface
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement focuses on command execution capabilities
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Commands, Authentication, Results, Projects
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties marked for clarification"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning after clarifications)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer or cloud administrator working with Google Cloud Platform, I want to execute gcloud SDK commands directly through the Kode CLI interface so that I can manage GCP resources without switching between different terminal sessions or authentication contexts.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have gcloud SDK installed and configured, **When** I execute a gcloud command through the tool, **Then** the command runs successfully and returns the expected output
2. **Given** I need to list my GCP projects, **When** I run `gcloud projects list` through the tool, **Then** I see a formatted list of all accessible projects
3. **Given** I want to deploy an application, **When** I execute deployment commands through the tool, **Then** the deployment proceeds with proper authentication and feedback
4. **Given** I need to check resource status, **When** I run monitoring or status commands, **Then** I receive current resource information in a readable format
5. **Given** I execute an invalid gcloud command, **When** the tool processes it, **Then** I receive clear error messages and suggested corrections

### Edge Cases
- What happens when gcloud SDK is not installed or not in PATH?
- How does the system handle authentication failures or expired credentials?
- What occurs when network connectivity is lost during command execution?
- How are long-running commands (like deployments) handled and displayed?
- What happens when users lack permissions for specific GCP resources?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST execute valid gcloud SDK commands in the shell environment
- **FR-002**: System MUST preserve user authentication context when executing commands
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to execute any standard gcloud command supported by their SDK version
- **FR-004**: System MUST display command output in a readable format within the Kode interface
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle both interactive and non-interactive gcloud commands
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide clear error messages when commands fail or are invalid
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to execute commands that require confirmation prompts
- **FR-008**: System MUST support command history and recall for previously executed gcloud commands
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate that gcloud SDK is available before attempting command execution
- **FR-010**: System MUST detect when gcloud SDK is not authenticated and provide helpful authorization tips and commands
- **FR-011**: System MUST format command output as structured JSON when supported by the command, falling back to raw terminal output for commands that don't support JSON formatting
- **FR-012**: System MUST execute gcloud commands directly and handle any syntax or validation errors returned by the gcloud SDK
- **FR-013**: System MUST display progress indicators for long-running commands and allow users to cancel operations in progress
- **FR-014**: System MUST manage project context [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should tool track/switch GCP projects automatically?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **GCloud Command**: Represents a gcloud SDK command with arguments, flags, and execution context
- **Authentication Context**: User or service account credentials and permissions for GCP access
- **Command Result**: Output, error messages, exit codes, and execution metadata from command execution
- **GCP Project**: Google Cloud project context including project ID, permissions, and resource access
- **Command History**: Record of previously executed commands for recall and repetition

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-01
- Q: What authentication method(s) should the tool support for Google Cloud access? ‚Üí A: Skip - provide tips when not authorized
- Q: How should the tool format and display gcloud command output? ‚Üí A: Structured JSON when possible, raw for others
- Q: Should the tool validate gcloud command syntax before execution? ‚Üí A: Execute directly and handle errors from gcloud SDK
- Q: How should the tool handle long-running gcloud commands? ‚Üí A: Show progress indicators with ability to cancel
